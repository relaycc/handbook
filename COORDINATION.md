# Overview

High-level (e.g. inter-project) coordination is done here. Right now it's just
the roadmap.

# Roadmap

The roadmap is a written account of everything that we want to get done and of
our actual progress towards those goals. For now, it consists of a series of
checkpoint documents. Each checkpoint document must include at least the
following sections: background, goals, active development, pending development,
open development, and open questions. You can find the checkpoint documents in
`/roadmap`.

### Background

This is a description of the current state of affairs. What has recently
completed? What external events occurred that we need to react to? How are
things going in general?

### Goals

This is a description of what we're trying to accomplish. This section is the
"why" corresponding to the development sections' "how".

### Active Development

This is a description of what we're working on right now.

### Pending Development

This is a description of what we will be working on next.

### Open Development

This is a description of things we should probably do that we don't have a
feasible plan for yet.

### Open Questions

This is a description of what we're unsure about, questions that we do not have
answers to that we should probably resolve soon.
